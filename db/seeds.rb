While the natural beauty of the area was never doubted, the years of piecemeal building and hastily constructed dwellings fell short of his concept of a great international city. His mark would be made on the city's landscape with several grand estates as well as the Halladie Building and The Palace of Fine Arts. His guidance was sought after the Great Earthquake of 1906, as he was one of 50 architects handpicked by Mayor Schmitz to design a new city.

The once-reliable source of cheap labor that the maritime industry relied upon was much harder to recruit when men were blinded by visions of gold. The gambler's lust for an easy way out tempted many away from the backbreaking months at sea that made up the life of a merchant sailor. Yet the need for workers did not diminish, and so new recruiting tactics were needed. Crimping (also called Shanghai'ing) was the answer. Inns would entice men with spiked drinks and the promise of cheap boarding. Then, intoxicated to the point of vulnerability, the poor souls were kidnapped for months of hard work at sea. James Kelley was the most infamous of all the crimpers. It is said he even threw a party for himself, and later delivered all of the guests to a steamer ship; for a handsome fee of course.",

He had recently suffered a stroke, and at the age of 78, he created a trust to manage the disposal of his estate. The majority of his money was to be generously given back to the bay area community and public causes he cared about. He left large sums for the prevention of cruelty to animals, a home for aging widows, an orphanage, a school for the mechanical arts, and public baths to name a few. We now know that his greatest legacy is the Lick Observatory on top of Mount Hamilton. The $700,000 used to build the observatory was originally intended for his pyramid.",

He is mostly famous for writing stories of rugged men struggling to survive in the harsh conditions of Alaska and Canada. In his early twenties he experienced, and barely lived through, these conditions that he later wrote about. As he became famous, London spent more and more time in cities with other writers and fans, drinking, telling stories, and enjoying the excesses of his celebrity. This lifestyle, and his exposure to tropical diseases during his travels, took a toll on his strength and appearance. In an attempt to regain his health, he moved to Sonoma county and tried in earnest to become a rancher. He idealized his plan for rejuvenation in some of his later books such as "In the Valley of the Moon" and "The Little Lady of the Big House". In reality, his health continued to fade, and he died in 1916 at the age of 40.',

                    'Cause I heard you state the following<br>
                    As other guests were happy swallowing<br>
                    The milk and honey of their fate<br>
                    Yes in haste you uttered<br>
                    <br>
                    Oh what I don't want to know<br>
                    Oh you're still gonna go on<br>
                    But you're speaking of the trappings of love<br>
                    And can't you see it<br>
                    I learned long ago<br>
                    To let go<br>
                    <br>
                    Oh lovely soul<br>
                    You keep calling out to the ones that hold you down",
